## Motivation

While the technology landscape has changed and cloud-native infrastructure is popular, sometimes you've just got
a bunch of Linux servers and you need a sane way to manage their configurations. Traditionally, you'd use a tool
like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. Those are great tools! If they work for you, then there's no reason to try Caravel.
However, if you're tired of the slow performance and YAML-hell that is Ansible, or the complicated infrastructure, setup,
and learning curve of Puppet, then Caravel might be worth a try.

The purpose of Caravel is to be super flexible and "blazingly fast". Using Lua as a programmable configuration language
and Rust as the engine allows the best of both worlds! 

- Caravel can be ran agentless or agentful. 

- You can direct connect or use a proxy. 

- You can build out an inventory or just point and shoot at any number of servers.

Caravel is and will always be open-source and free.
